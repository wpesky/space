Project Space
=============

Based on [Space Uncharted](http://spaceuncharted.com/). (though Project Space still has a long way to go)

Space Uncharted is a great game, but has some really annoying bugs. Also, there is a lag after every click, and it just seems like overdoing it to use a canvas with FPS, when we could be using images with absolute positioning. Today's computers and even tablets can handle it just fine. Oh yea, did I mention double-clicks?

OK, sorry for the rant, but as a passionate developer, I couldn't resist the temptation to start one of my own, better.

Until this is ready, try out Space Uncharted, get hooked, and then if you feel inclined you can help me with the remake. :D
